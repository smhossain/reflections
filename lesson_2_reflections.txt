When a git repository is initialized, it creates the .git folder than includes the needed metadata required for the git to track the changes in the files.

the staging area is where all the changes are made before committing them to the repository.

The staging area is still a mystery for me!!! I should exactly know what is itâ€™s role.

Branches help in making different versions of a program or adding a feature that you are not sure about yet. Or making a different language of your program etc.

the diagrams help in knowing the branches and how the commits are branched in different branches.

Merging two branches results in merging whatever changes made to the different branches into one file. The diagram shows where the branch started and where did it go and when it was merged with the master.

Automatically merging is good when there are no big changes in the code. Manual merging is better because different versions of a code might lead to different results. So, definitely someone has to clear the conflict.
